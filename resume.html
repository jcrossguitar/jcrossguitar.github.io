    My name is Jon Cross and I am a Full Stack Web Developer. I am a musician and I play multiple instruments, 
    but I mainly have the most experience with stringed instruments. I play the guitar (acoustic and electric), piano/organ, drums, percussion, 
    bass guitar, banjo, violin, mandolin, ukelele, and harmonica. I plan on learning more when I acquire 
    more instruments. My favorite to play is guitar. I play in my spare time at home, with friends and also 
    at a few Open Mic nights. I have a dog that I love to get out every day and have her run around at various 
    locations. I also really enjoy cooking. I have found that I am actually pretty good at it when I have 
    the time to make a meal and I have become extremely efficient at prepping, combining and cooking the food. 
    I like to believe that even this explanation of my life can be applied to my dedication to any task at hand. 
    I am earger to learn things I do not know and eager to do things more efficiently. I have a habit of becomming 
    completely enveloped in whatever it is I am doing and I find myself obsessed with doing the best that I am able to. 
    I also greatly look forward to a rewarding relationship between hardwork and satisfaction.

      I really enojy playing video games from time to time. Mostly Pokemon to be quite honest. I have quite 
      the collection of vintage games that I like to return to and play about once a year. I used to be more 
      interested in video games in my youth, but I feel that right now, my time is better spent learning and 
      staying physically/mentally active. I have been trying to lead a healthier lifestyle as well as a more 
      active one which includes eating healthy as well as exercising on a routine basis.

  <h4 id="sectionh2">About My Personal Career Interests</h4>
  <p id="p1">
        I am really interested in staying within the healtcare field. I currently work in 3 different 
        emergency rooms. I consider this some of my most valuable experience to date. I believe this 
        because I am able to do my job well under the most extreme pressure and stressful circumstances. 
        I need to be right so that the hospital staff gets paid and so the patients avoid financially 
        crippling medical bills. Sometimes I only have a certain amount of time to perform my job before a patient 
        undergoes life saving surgery.

        I am from New Jersey and I moved to San Diego with my girlfriend for a better life three years ago. We have found many amazing 
        people, food and places since we decided to move across the country. We came to San Diego with all our posessions in the back of 
        a small truck and an adventurous spirit. It has been an incredible experience we both are still in the midst of. We 
        have established ourselves enough that we feel comfortable calling San Diego home. I would love to stay with Sharp 
        and move my career forward with pride and anticipation for a better future.
