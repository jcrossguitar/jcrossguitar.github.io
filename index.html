    My name is Jon Cross and I am making a Full Stack Web Developer. I am well versed 
    in multiple languages such as HTML, CSS, AND JAVASCRIPT. I have worked with numerous libraries
    such as AJAX, JSON, NODE, REACT, and BOOTSTRAP. I have learned a lot, but I can always
    learn more.

    I am really interested in staying within the healtcare field. I currently work in 3 different 
    emergency rooms. I consider this some of my most valuable experience to date. I believe this 
    because I am able to do my job well under the most extreme pressure and stressful circumstances. 
    I need to be right so that the hospital staff gets paid and so the patients avoid financially 
    crippling medical bills. Sometimes I only have a certain amount of time to perform my job before a patient 
    undergoes life saving surgery.

    I am a musician and I play multiple instruments, but I mainly have the most experience with 
    stringed instruments. I play the guitar (acoustic and electric), piano/organ, drums, percussion, 
    bass guitar, banjo, violin, mandolin, ukelele, and harmonica. I plan on learning more when I acquire 
    more instruments. My favorite to play is guitar. I play in my spare time at home, with friends and also 
    at a few Open Mic nights. I have a dog that I love to get out every day and have her run around at various 
    locations. I also really enjoy cooking. I have found that I am actually pretty good at it when I have 
    the time to make a meal and I have become extremely efficient at prepping, combining and cooking the food. 
    I like to believe that even this explanation of my life can be applied to my dedication to any task at hand. 
    I am earger to learn things I do not know and eager to do things more efficiently. I have a habit of becomming 
    completely enveloped in whatever it is I am doing and I find myself obsessed with doing the best that I am able to. 
    I also greatly look forward to a rewarding relationship between hardwork and satisfaction.

    I am from New Jersey and I moved to San Diego with my girlfriend for a better life three years ago. We have found many amazing 
    people, food and places since we decided to move across the country. We came out here with nothing and no one 
    and we are making our own way at the moment. It has been an adventure we both are still in the midst of. We 
    have established ourselves enough we feel comfortable calling San Diego home. I would love to stay with Sharp 
    and move my career forward with pride and anticipation for a better future.
